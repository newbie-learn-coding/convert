 * Options include:
 * - `failsafe`: supports generic mappings, generic sequences and generic
 * strings.
 * - `json`: extends `failsafe` schema by also supporting nulls, booleans,
 * integers and floats.
 * - `core`: functionally the same as `json` schema.
 * - `default`: extends `core` schema by also supporting binary, omap, pairs and
 * set types.
 * - `extended`: extends `default` schema by also supporting regular
 * expressions and undefined values.
 *
 * See
 * {@link https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#chapter-10-recommended-schemas | YAML 1.2 spec}
 * for more details on the `failsafe`, `json` and `core` schemas.
