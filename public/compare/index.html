    <h1>File Format Comparison Guides</h1>
    <p>Use compare file formats guides to decide the right default output policy before execution, then route teams to the correct conversion workflow with fewer downstream exceptions.</p>
  </header>
  <section>
    <h2>What is compare file formats guides?</h2>
    <p>Compare file formats guides are decision playbooks for selecting one default format based on measurable trade-offs. Teams use compare file formats guides to align quality expectations, compatibility risk, and delivery-size impact before starting conversion work across products, content pipelines, or support operations.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>How to run comparison-first decisions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose one representative asset that reflects real production constraints.</li>
      <li>Evaluate both formats for quality, compatibility, and output size in target channels.</li>
      <li>Record the winner and the exception triggers in the relevant comparison guide.</li>
      <li>Hand off to the matching conversion guide for repeatable implementation.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>When comparison-first workflows are critical</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When teams disagree on default export format for shared assets.</li>
      <li>When one destination channel has stricter compatibility constraints than others.</li>
      <li>When delivery performance and quality need a documented balance point.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to score quality, compatibility, and delivery impact</h2>
    <p>For each comparison, run one short benchmark cycle and score outcomes against the same rubric so teams can explain why a default format was selected. A reliable scorecard prevents preference-driven debates and keeps production decisions aligned to measurable outcomes.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Quality score:</strong> verify visual/audio fidelity, edit tolerance, and artifact risk after one realistic export path.</li>
      <li><strong>Compatibility score:</strong> test browser playback, mobile behavior, CMS/editor support, and stakeholder review tooling.</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery score:</strong> compare file size, transfer reliability, cache behavior, and publishing turnaround time.</li>
      <li><strong>Policy confidence score:</strong> document exception triggers and rollback path before promoting one format as default.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Keep benchmark evidence in a shared release note so content, engineering, and operations teams reuse the same baseline during future launches instead of re-running ad hoc evaluations.</p>

    <h2>Policy handoff checklist before rollout</h2>
    <p>After choosing a winner, teams should publish an explicit handoff checklist so new contributors can execute the decision without guessing. This keeps quality stable when ownership changes or when the same comparison appears in multiple workflows.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Declare one default format and list the top two exception scenarios that justify using the alternate format.</li>
      <li>Link the default comparison to the exact conversion guide that implements the chosen output policy.</li>
      <li>Define the minimum QA proof required before batch publishing (for example: sample file diff, destination render test, and reviewer sign-off).</li>
      <li>Capture rollback rules in one paragraph so incident responders can revert quickly when downstream platforms behave unexpectedly.</li>
      <li>Review these rules every quarter to confirm they still match current browser, app, and distribution constraints.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Example comparison governance note</h2>
    <p>A practical governance note should answer three questions in plain language: what default format was selected, what measurable evidence supported the decision, and under which conditions teams may override the default. Keep this note short enough to read during release reviews, but specific enough that different contributors will make the same choice without additional meetings.</p>
    <p>For example, if a team selects WEBP over JPG for homepage delivery, the note should include the observed size reduction range, the tested browser support baseline, and the fallback trigger for channels that still require JPG. Capturing these details once prevents future policy drift and reduces rework caused by inconsistent assumptions between design, development, and publishing teams.</p>
